# Expense Tracker

This is my solution to a beginner JavaScript project. I mainly focused on the functionality of the project so I didn't include styling and media queries.

## Overview

Users should be able to:

- add expenses only when all three inputs are filled
- remove expenses
- save expenses upon reloading page
